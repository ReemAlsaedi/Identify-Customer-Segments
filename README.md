# Identify-Customer-Segments
## Problem Statement:

My primary objective is to use unsupervised learning techniques to identify and analyze customer segments within the dataset. This involves several steps: loading and preprocessing the data, applying clustering algorithms to uncover distinct customer segments, and analyzing these segments to understand their characteristics. The identified segments will help in directing marketing campaigns towards audiences with the highest expected return on investment. I will need to make decisions on how to treat the data at various stages, documenting my approach and justifications throughout the project.

## Dataset Overview:

The dataset for this project contains detailed customer information for a mail-order sales company in Germany. It has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and represents a real-life data science task. The data includes various attributes that will be used to identify distinct customer segments. The goal is to apply unsupervised learning techniques to uncover these segments, which can then be targeted for more effective marketing campaigns.



## Results:

Upon completion of this project, I will have successfully identified core customer segments for the mail-order sales company. The analysis will provide actionable insights into the characteristics of different customer groups, allowing for targeted marketing strategies. The project will be evaluated not only on the effectiveness of the segmentation but also on the clarity and justification of the decisions made throughout the analysis process.
